This compiler is a project for Case Western Reserve University's 
EECS 337 course (Compiler Design).

Currently, we have a working implementation of linked lists 
and hash tables for our symbol table. 

Note that using the same key for multiple values will result
in only the most recent value being accessible due to how
the linked lists are implemented.


COMPILING
=========

To compile the project thus far, run 'make' or 'make test'.
Both will make the test suite, an executable named test_suite.
Running test_suite will perform tests on the linked list and
hash table implementations. The actual test code can be found 
in test_suite.c
