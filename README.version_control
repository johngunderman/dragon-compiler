Notes on the version control system used for this project:

NOTE: If you are cloning this project of github or another
git repo, don't worry about this document. It is primarily
for the TAs who will be grading it.


The versioning control system used for this project is known
as git (git-scm.com). Git is a distributed source control 
management tool (scm). In short, what this means is that the
copy of the project that I have on my machine right now is
a repository of its own. I can commit to it just like one
would commit to a remote repo in svn. If you're interested
in learning more about git, I suggest just visiting their
website, because I'm just going to cut to the chase here
and tell you that I have a sync'd repo living on volatile
and I have on on github. However, since the github repo is
public, I will only push (update) to it with code that has
already been due. That's my scm in a nutshell.
